Recipes
A fun project that uses food2fork API combining MongoDB, Express, Angular & Node. I also used materialize bootstrap to make it nice and pretty. 

Getting Started

Prerequisites
You will need to install Angular, Express, Node, and MongoDB.

Packages/dependencies for the backend. (Done in your Terminal)
NPM init -y, express, mongoose, body-parser, express-session, and path. 
Angular Project Set-up:  
Open a terminal window for creating & working with Angular 
ng new public --routing  	(can also use client, static or www in place of “public”)
npm install
Add Components and Services:
	ng generate component new-component_name
	ng generate service new-service_name
	ng generate class new-class_name
	ng generate pipe new_pipe_name


Running the tests
To run your test you must have your mongod, ng build -w , and nodemon running. 
If you want to check your database, have mongo open and query in the terminal.
